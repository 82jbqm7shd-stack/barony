<section>
  <h2>Historical origin</h2>
  <p>
    The Barony of Balvill was created as a feudal barony by Crown charter dated 5 August 1630,
    granted by King Charles I in favour of Archibald Campbell, Lord Lorne, later Earl and Marquess of Argyll.
    In its original form, the feudal barony comprised lands and jurisdiction recorded in charter materials,
    including references to Jura, Oronsay, and Colonsay.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Parliamentary confirmation</h2>
  <p>
    The 1630 charter was confirmed by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland dated 28 June 1633.
    Such confirmation provided statutory recognition of the barony within the constitutional framework
    of seventeenth-century Scotland.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Continuity and historical holding</h2>
  <p>
    Following its creation, the feudal Barony of Balvill remained associated with the Campbell family,
    passing through the line of the Earls and later Dukes of Argyll.
    Over time, the barony formed part of a wider complex of historic titles and jurisdictions held by that house.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Transition to modern status</h2>
  <p>
    The abolition of feudal land tenure in Scotland, which came into force in 2004,
    brought an end to feudal landholding while preserving baronies as dignities.
    Since that date, the Barony of Balvill has existed as an incorporeal heritable dignity,
    capable of conveyance by assignation and no longer dependent on ownership of land.
  </p>
  <p>
    References to lands and jurisdiction on this page reflect the historical form of the barony
    and do not imply present-day land ownership.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Assignation and registration (2025)</h2>
  <p>
    In 2025, the Barony of Balvill was assigned to Mark Hopking.
    Documentation relating to the assignation and registration is held in the private papers of the present holder.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Scottish Barony Register maintains an official register of baronies,
    in which many entries are marked as private.
    Inclusion on the register may corroborate the existence of a barony as a recognised dignity,
    without constituting public evidence of proprietorship where details are not disclosed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Debrett’s, an independent directory of titles and styles, lists the Barony of Balvill
    and records Mark Hopking as its current holder.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Name and orthography</h2>
  <p>
    Historical records frequently show variation in the spelling of Scottish territorial names.
    The barony appears in documentary sources under several forms, including <em>Balvill</em> and <em>Baluill</em>.
    In the period immediately preceding the 2025 assignation, the spelling “Barwill” was commonly used.
    Upon registration, the spelling “Balvill” was adopted to reflect the earlier charter form.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Stewardship and usage</h2>
  <p>
    In contemporary discussion, the holding of the barony is framed in terms of stewardship
    and custodianship of a historic dignity.
    Accepted styles of address associated with Scottish baronies are treated as conventions
    rather than as expressions of the barony’s historical or legal significance.
  </p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Heraldry</h2>
  <p>
    The grant of arms held by Mark Hopking predates the assignation of the barony.
    The barony did not confer arms, and any heraldic matters relating to the present holder
    are addressed separately.
    Further detail is provided on the <a href="https://heraldry.markhopking.co.uk/">Heraldry</a> page.
