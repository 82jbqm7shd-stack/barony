    <section id="historical-origin">
      <h2>Historical origin</h2>
      <p>
        The Barony of Balvill was created as a feudal barony by Crown charter dated 5 August 1630, granted by King Charles I
        in favour of Archibald Campbell, Lord Lorne (later Earl and Marquess of Argyll).<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup>
        The charter describes a composite barony, with its principal messuage situated in Stirlingshire and additional lands
        and jurisdictions recorded elsewhere, including holdings in Jura, Oronsay, and Colonsay.<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="parliamentary-confirmation">
      <h2>Parliamentary confirmation</h2>
      <p>
        The 1630 charter was confirmed by an Act of the Parliament of Scotland dated 28 June 1633.<sup><a href="#ref-2">[2]</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="continuity">
      <h2>Continuity of holding</h2>
      <p>
        The barony remained associated with the Campbell family and later the house of Argyll across subsequent centuries. A detailed history of the barony is here - <a href="/history.html">History of the Barony of Balvill</a>      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="modern-status">
      <h2>Transition to modern status</h2>
      <p>
        The abolition of feudal land tenure in Scotland (in force 2004) ended feudal landholding while preserving baronies as dignities.
        Since that date, the Barony of Balvill has existed as an incorporeal heritable dignity, capable of conveyance by assignation and no longer dependent on ownership of land.
      </p>
      <p>
        References on this page to lands and jurisdiction relate to the historical form of the barony and do not imply present-day land ownership.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="assignation-2025">
      <h2>Assignation and registration in 2025</h2>
      <p>
        In 2025 the Barony of Balvill was assigned to Mark Hopking.<sup><a href="#ref-3">[3]</a></sup>
        A certificate of registration for the dignity is held in the private papers of the present holder.<sup><a href="#ref-5">[5]</a></sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Scottish Barony Register publishes an “Official Register of Baronies”, in which many entries are marked as private.
        Inclusion on that public list may corroborate the existence of a barony as a recorded dignity without constituting public evidence of proprietorship where details are not disclosed.<sup><a href="#ref-6">[6]</a></sup>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="name-orthography">
      <h2>Name and orthography</h2>
      <p>
        Historical Scottish territorial designations often appear with spelling variation over time.
        Documentary materials include forms such as <em>Balvill</em> and <em>Baluill</em>.<sup><a href="#ref-1">[1]</a></sup>
        In the period immediately preceding the 2025 assignation, the modernised spelling “Barwill” was in use in some contexts;
        upon registration, the form “Balvill” was adopted to reflect the earlier charter tradition.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="stewardship">
      <h2>Stewardship and usage</h2>
      <p>
        Contemporary commentary by the present holder frames the barony primarily as stewardship and custodianship of a historic dignity.
        Accepted styles of address associated with Scottish baronies are treated as conventions and are not used as running styles on this site.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="heraldry">
      <h2>Heraldry</h2>
      <p>
        The grant of arms held by Mark Hopking predates the 2025 assignation of the barony.
        Heraldic detail is treated separately on the <a href="https://heraldry.markhopking.co.uk/">Heraldry</a> page.
